# üèÄBasketball Detection Using YOLOv5

This project demonstrates how to detect basketballs in videos using the YOLOv5 object detection model. It leverages the power of PyTorch and OpenCV to perform real-time object detection on video frames.

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to detect basketballs in a video stream using the pre-trained YOLOv5 model. YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. This project loads the model, processes the video frame by frame, detects basketballs, and displays the results.

## Features

- Loads YOLOv5 pre-trained model.
- Processes video input to detect basketballs.
- Displays bounding boxes and confidence scores on detected basketballs.
- Uses OpenCV for video frame capture and display.
- Works efficiently on CPU or GPU (if available).
